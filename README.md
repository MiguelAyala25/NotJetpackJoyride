# JetpackJoyride clone made in unity
# üìù About The Project

This game is an endless runner inspired by the popular Jetpack Joyride, where players control a character equipped with a jetpack to navigate through a series of obstacles, collect coins, and earn points. Developed as a team project, our goal was to build the most polished version of the game within an 11-week period, incorporating various gameplay mechanics and visual effects to enhance the user experience.

## Features I worked on

Player Controller:

Manages the character's movement and interactions in the game, including jetpack mechanics, jumping, and collision handling. Below is a summary of the functionalities I    worked on:

Movement Mechanics:

- Jetpack Mode: Activates when the player holds the input, applying an upward force to simulate jetpack propulsion.
- Jump Mode: Triggers a jump force when the player is on the ground and presses the input.
- Gravity Mode: Applies a downward force simulating gravity when no input is detected or the player is mid-air without jetpack activation.
- Input Handling for desktop and mobile
- Fixed bugs and enhanced the feels of the movement.

CustomForces:
- Gravity Force: Applied continuously unless jetpack or jump forces are active.
- Jetpack Force: Applied when jetpack is enabled, creating upward movement.
- Jump Force: Applied when a jump is initiated from the ground.

Collision Management:

- Ground Detection.
- Obstacle Collision.

NPCs:

- Developed NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) that react to player actions, enhancing the game's dynamic feel.

Animations:

- Configured animations for both NPCs and the player character, ensuring smooth transitions and engaging visuals.
